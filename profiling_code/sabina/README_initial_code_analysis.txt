Documentation from HW8:

For my initial code analysis, I put the cleaned data I created from HW7 into a Hive table called first_code_drop. You can find that cleaned dataset named cleaned.csv in HDFS under directories: HW7/cleaned_data/. I have already provided access to that in the previous homework. After creating the hive table, I observed to see if the data populated correctly, which it did. Then, I observed distinct "time" values to see how many years are included in this dataset. I also observed distinct GeoIDs because that will be the Join ID we will be using to join our datasets together so it is important to see what these are in each dataset to ensure they are compatible. I then ran distinct "geography" as they are supposed to align with the GEOId. I noticed that there were 47 distinct Geo IDs, but 48 different neighborhoods, so there was an inconsistency. To analyze this further, I then selected distinct "GeoId, Geography" and found that a GeoId of 1 was repeated, one for New York City as a whole and another for Bronx, so I decide to clean this later (will be discussed below). I then found the means and medians of the numerical data columns, but found it did not make sense to find the mode for my dataset as the other columns are themselves are calculations or counts, so they are unique values that shouldn't or wouldn't provide any meaningful information to find the modes of.
