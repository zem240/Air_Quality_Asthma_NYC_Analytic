After cleaning the data using MapReduce, I do further cleaning on my data already in Hive. This builds off the table, the initial_code_analysis's first_code_drop table I have under the sabina subdirectory in the profiling_code_directory.

As for the code cleaning, I decided to do 2 cleaning options that made sense for my dataset, text-formatting for future joining and creating a binary column based on the condition of another column. I created a new table called code_cleaning in which I replaced the GeoID for rows with geography of New York City from 1 to 0 so that we do not run into any errors with joining the dataset later on. Then, I created another column for the standardized rate across age groups, which is the age-adjusted rate and decided  a new binary column called high_adjusted_rate, where the value is 1 if the Age-adjusted rate per 10,000 is greater than the mean of 107.652 we found earlier, and 0 otherwise. This could be a meaningful analysis because it could help identify areas that may require more attention and resources to address asthma-related health issues. I then run 2 select commands to confirm these changes and implementations.
